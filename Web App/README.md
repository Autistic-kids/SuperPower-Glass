# Web App

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a HTML & CSS & BOOTSTRAP & JS & PHP SDK Firebase project.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first project:
- [Lab: Write your first HTML,CSS,JS,PHP app](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp)
- [Cookbook: Useful BackEnd samples](https://firebase-php.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and a full API reference.

view the [online web static](https://kids-87f4a.web.app/index.html).

When downloading this code, it does not work because it needs to download PLATFORM SDK and link it to autoload.php file
